## Description: <br>
Build Docker-backed PAIDF Simulation commands for PCBA synthetic-data renders (good/defect/missing/lighting/ChangeNet pairs) and ROI crops with optional MI registration. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers generating synthetic training data for PCB automated optical inspection (AOI) using Docker-backed simulation pipelines. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`claude-code`) <br>
- Codex (`codex`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 15 internal skill evaluation tasks with 2 attempts per task (pass threshold 50%). <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies that the agent loaded the expected skill and workflow. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Checks routing quality, decoy avoidance, and redundant tool usage. <br>
- `accuracy`: Grades final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Checks whether the overall user task completed successfully. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies expected behavior steps, including safety expectations. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Compares token usage with and without the skill. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Dimension | Num | `claude-code` | `codex` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Security | 8 | 97% (-3%) | 100% (+7%) |
| Correctness | 8 | 82% (-1%) | 67% (+3%) |
| Discoverability | 8 | 92% (+4%) | 74% (-0%) |
| Effectiveness | 8 | 57% (-2%) | 51% (+4%) |
| Efficiency | 8 | 81% (+6%) | 62% (-2%) |
